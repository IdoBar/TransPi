We tested TransPi using the followings deployment methods:

- conda = individual conda environments per process

- docker = using TransPi container (i.e. -profile docker,TransPiContainer)

- singularity = using TransPi container (i.e. -profile singularity,TransPiContainer)


[NOTE]
Using individual container per process is working for the majority of processes. However, we found a couple os issues with some containers (e.g. transabyss). We are working to find a solution for these issues.


= Reporting an issue

If you find a problem or get an error please let us know by opening an issue in the repository.


= Test dataset

We include a `test` profile to try TransPi using a small dataset. However, this can create issues in some of the process (e.g. contamination removal by psytrans).
